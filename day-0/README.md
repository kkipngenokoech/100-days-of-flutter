# Day 0

we are going to explore the traditional thing everyone has to do when starting out a language - `hello world`.

## setting up an helloWorld project

when we set up an application, it is normally a stateless widget.

## hot reload

this is a feature in flutter that allows you to quickly see the changes you make in your application without having to completely restart the app or loose it's current state

when you use hot reload flutter framework compiles only the changed parts of your code and inject them into your running application without rebuilding the entire app from scratch.
