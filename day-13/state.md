# STATE MANAGEMENT

state management solutions looks into:- seperating models from views. Models deals with the data for an app whilst views are classes that presents data on the screen.

in flutter, our widgets are the so called 'views' whilst models are the data classes we define. Models are concerned about managing data and the views are concerned about drawing the interface.
