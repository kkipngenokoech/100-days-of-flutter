# FIREBASE CLOUD MESSAGING

This helps us with app notifications. Using firbase cloud messaging (FCM) you can use to types of notifications to the client device:

1. Notifications tha are directly handled by FCM SDK
2. Data Messages

messages from firebase have a maximum payload of 4KB - that is there is 1024 word character limit.

Firebase has cloud messaging as well as in app messaging. FCM also allows configuring messages specific to targets such as GeoLocations, versions of the app, Languages, and User Audiences. This case is ideal when you wish to send notifications to a specific set of users.
